# College-portal-with-user-authentication
This C++ project focuses on building a secure offline portal for institutes, utilizing OOP to model key entities like students, teachers, courses, and attendance. It ensures scalable architecture, seamless data storage and retrieval, and user authentication for security. Testing and error handling are incorporated to maintain data integrity.
